HONEY (ARE U COMING?)
MÃ¥neskin

[Intro]
Meet me there where it never closes
Meet me there where it's never hopeless
All is fair in love, oh-oh-oh-oh
Honey, are you coming?

[Verse 1]
I know a place downtown, babe, if you wanna go
I'm gonna show you how this Italian amor
It's gonna love you harder than ever before
You will like it
We're gonna get sky-high and create a new world
Where somebody might die, but nobody gets hurt
And if it sounds good for you, baby, just say the word
You will like it (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's 5 AM
We feel so good, it's almost frightening
It's 5 AM
I'm made for you, we can't deny it

[Chorus]
Meet me there where it never closes
Meet me there where it's never hopeless
All is fair in love, oh-oh-oh-oh
Honey, are you coming?
Meet me there where it never closes
Meet me there, I'll give you your roses
All is fair in love, oh-oh-oh-oh
Honey, are you coming?

[Verse 2]
Before I found this place I was feeling so blue
But then it turned me out, let it do it to you
It's not a one-night stand if it turns into two
Oh, I like it (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's 5 AM
We feel so good, it's almost frightening
Let's try again
I don't deserve you, you're a diamond

[Chorus]
Meet me there where it never closes
Meet me there where it's never hopeless
All is fair in love, oh-oh-oh-oh
Honey, are you coming?
Meet me there where it never closes
Meet me there, I'll give you your roses
All is fair in love, oh-oh-oh-oh
Honey, are you coming?

[Outro]
Honey, are you coming?
